3.  **Verify Setup with Connectivity Probe**:
    
    The connectivity probe is an integration smoke test that verifies Turbine API integration:
    
    ```bash
    # Basic read-only test (no authentication required)
    python3 -m src.tools.connectivity_probe
    
    # Expected output:
    # - API Health: OK
    # - BTC Quick Market details (strike price, end time)
    # - Orderbook snapshot (best bid/ask, total depth)
    # - Exit code 0
    ```
    
    **With WebSocket Test** (optional):
    ```bash
    python3 -m src.tools.connectivity_probe --ws-test
    
    # Tests:
    # - WebSocket connection to Turbine
    # - Market subscription
    # - Receipt of orderbook/trade messages
    ```
    
    > [!TIP]
    > The connectivity probe uses `TurbineAdapter` with your `config.yaml` settings. It's a real integration smoke test, not just a simple API ping.

4.  **Run Simulation (No Trading)**:
    ```bash
    python src/main.py --simulated
    ```
